## Description

This project is a web application based on Node.js, developed using JavaScript and TypeScript languages, and employs the NestJS framework. The primary purpose of this application is to provide a comprehensive time management system for employees within an organization. Features include employee registration and managerial functionalities, such as clock-in/out, lunch breaks, and other activities related to time tracking.

For data storage and management, the project utilizes the PostgreSQL database, offering a robust and reliable environment for handling employee information.

Furthermore, the application integrates an authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring security and access control to the application's resources.

The project architecture follows the principles of Clean Architecture, providing an organized and easily maintainable structure. The implementation is tested through unit tests for all endpoints, ensuring system quality and robustness.

For better understanding and interaction, the application features comprehensive documentation made available through Swagger, allowing users an overview of the functionalities and endpoints available in the first version of the project. This version represents an initial milestone, establishing the foundations for future improvements and expansions.
